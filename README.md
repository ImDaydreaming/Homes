# Homes

  Players will be able to purchase a home from the shop keeper. Upon purchasing they'll be allowed to open a more complex shop keeper menu from the designated location for their home.
In the more complex shop keeper menu, they'll be able to teleport to their home, upgrade their home (if possible) or apply and remove decorations they've unlocked.
Once a home is upgraded, the designated home location is changed to whatever location is specified for that home level.

  When a player teleports to their island, they'll be teleported to a certain location at the home that they can set themselves.
